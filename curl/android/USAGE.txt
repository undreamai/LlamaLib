Using the Static curl Library in Android Projects
================================================

The built libcurl.a is completely static and has no external dependencies.

For NDK/JNI Integration:
-----------------------
1. Copy libcurl.a to your project's libs directory
2. Add to your CMakeLists.txt:

   add_library(curl STATIC IMPORTED)
   set_target_properties(curl PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION
       ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/${ANDROID_ABI}/libcurl.a)
   
   target_link_libraries(your_target curl)

3. Include headers in your C/C++ code:
   #include <curl/curl.h>

Compiler Flags:
--------------
When linking, you may need these flags:
-static -Wl,--gc-sections

The library includes:
- OpenSSL (SSL/TLS support)
- zlib (compression support)
- All required dependencies statically linked

No additional .so files are required at runtime.
